# c5 Community

This mobile application enables the access to the community area of concrete5.org in a mobile optimized way. Currently the app is still in its early stages of development and it is only possible to sign in via the app and use the forum of concrete5.org. You can search forums, create new posts, and respond to existing forum posts.

â€¨Further features are already planned and updates will follow on a regularly basis.

The app is an unofficial app. This means that the app was not developed by concrete5 or Portland Labs (the company behind concrete5).
